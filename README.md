## Project Description:
Team Name: Stack Underflow

Creators: Reinier Cruz Carnero, Xuanting Liu, Chason Pratt, Taylor Frederick

Project Description: The purpose of the website was to showcase the ideals, events and general information related to the organization. It allows new members to learn more about the org and how they can get involved themselves. It also serves as a platform where organization officers can share both the accomplishments of their club and what they hope to achieve in the future. Furthermore, the website provides users with the ability to easily stay up to date with organization events through the use of an integrated Google Calendar.

## Explanation of Branches:
Main - Combination of Client and Backend Mod

Frontend - Using React and CSS to create the frontend of the website

Backend - Using Node.js and MongoDB to connect to the database that stores information about each page of the website

Client - Updated version of Frontend

The website on Heroku runs off a forked version of this repository so that we could test our code in this repository without making any changes to the deployed website.
